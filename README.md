# Rocket
Build composable HTML pages with modern JavaScript and ðŸš€.

## Why?
Inspired to create a library that allows for the same
easy and flexible DOM rendering from JavaScript as React.
The goal was to reason about how React handles DOM rendering,
and create a rendering system from scratch that could be
used in assignments that require pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

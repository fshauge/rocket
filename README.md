# Rocket
Build composable HTML pages with modern JavaScript and ðŸš€.

## Why?
Inspired by React to create a library from that allows for
the same easy and flexible DOM rendering from JavaScript.
The goal was to reason about how React handles DOM rendering
and create a rendering system from scratch that could be
used in assignments that require pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
